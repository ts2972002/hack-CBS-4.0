## Structure : üóíÔ∏è
This application contains two main sections:
1) **chatbackend** : It handles the backend of the chat application. You may directly use it after cloning.

</br>

## Note : ‚ùó
The aplication uses Unsplash API.
After you have **cloned, created the react app and repleced the files** follow this steps to make the API working :

1) Go to https://unsplash.com/developers and register as a developer.</br>
2) After registering as a developer, you will be automatically redirected to your developer dashboard. Click on New Application.</br>
3) You will be asked to **accept the API Use and Guidelines**. Click the checkboxes then the **Accept terms** button to proceed further:</br>
4) You will then be prompted to give **your Application information**. Give your application an appropriate name and description, and click **Create application** .</br>
5) With this, you have created an application and can now access your **Access Key and Secret Key** under the Keys section. Copy these keys to a secure location.</br>
6) Create a **.env file** in the same directory in which src folder is present.</br>
7) Add your **api key as : API_APP_APP_KEY : <api_key>** </br>
